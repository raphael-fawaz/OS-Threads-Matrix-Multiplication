# OS-Threads-Matrix-Multiplication
Operating system course lab, fall 2022,CCE, FOE, Uof Alexandria.
Using threads in matrix multiplication.

## Problem Statement:
In this project, you will implement two variations of the matrix multiplication algorithm:
Version 1) The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
Version 2) The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.
